# Spring Microservice Sample

This demo application show you how to build an microservice application via Spring Boot.

Firstly install Docker, Docker Compose.

Start up dependent servers via `docker-compose` command.

```
docker-compose up
```

If you are using Docker Toolbox, create a new machine for this project.

```
$ docker-machine create -d virtualbox --engine-registry-mirror https://docker.m
irrors.ustc.edu.cn springms
```

Switch to the new created machine, `springms`.

```
eval "$(docker-machine env springms)"
```

Forward the virtualbox ports to local system, thus you can access the servers via `localhost` instead of the machine ip addresss.

```
 VBoxManage modifyvm "springms" --natpf1 "tcp-port3306,tcp,,3306,,3306"
 VBoxManage modifyvm "springms" --natpf1 "tcp-port3307,tcp,,3307,,3307"
 VBoxManage modifyvm "springms" --natpf1 "tcp-port5672,tcp,,5672,,5672"
 VBoxManage modifyvm "springms" --natpf1 "tcp-port15672,tcp,,15672,,15672"
 VBoxManage modifyvm "springms" --natpf1 "tcp-port6379,tcp,,6379,,6379"
 VBoxManage modifyvm "springms" --natpf1 "tcp-port27017,tcp,,27017,,27017"
```

Run the dependent servers via `docker-compose` command line.

```
docker-compose up
```

Run the services one by one.

```
mvn spring-boot:run // run in user-service, auth-service, post-service
```

When all are running successfully. 

Try to get authentication.

```
curl -v  http://localhost:8000/user -u user:test123
* timeout on name lookup is not supported
*   Trying ::1...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to localhost (::1) port 8000 (#0)
* Server auth using Basic with user 'user'
> GET /user HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:8000

```

You will see a `X-Auth-Token` header in the response.

Put this header into request header when you access the protected resources in another resource server.

```
curl -v  http://localhost:8001/user -H "x-auth-token: 49090ba7-e641-45e3-935b-894a43b85f62"
``` 

Try to add some posts data:

```
>curl -v  http://localhost:8002/posts 
-H "x-auth-token:  44586f33-4c51-4d8f-ab12-7ad25a1c3a30" 
-H "Accept: application/json" 
-H "Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8" 
-X POST 
-d "{\"title\": \"test post\", \"content\":\"test content of post\"}"
```

You will see the result. It returns 201 status, and set `Location` header to the new created `Post`.

```
Note: Unnecessary use of -X or --request, POST is already inferred.
