# Spring Microservice Sample

This demo application show you how to build an microservice application via Spring Boot.

There are three services in this demo.

* **auth-service** is the service for signin, signup and siginout.
* **user-service** is responsible for user management.
* **post-service** is the APIs for a simple CMS, including posts and comments.
* **nginx** includes the Dockerfile and nginx configuration file which use nginx as a reverse proxy for all services in a staging or production environment.


## Prerequisites

This demo sample is built on Spring stack, including Spring Boot, Spring Data, Spring Security, etc. Following the 12 factors application guide, I suggest to use Docker in both development and production enviroment to make sure the same codebase working in different environments.

Following the installation guide from [Docker official website](https://www.docker.com), install the latest Docker, Docker Compose and Docker Machine into your local system.

## Setup local development environment

Start up dependent servers via `docker-compose` command.

```
docker-compose up
```

### Docker Toolbox Notes

If you are using Docker Toolbox, create a new machine for this project.

```
$ docker-machine create -d virtualbox --engine-registry-mirror https://docker.mirrors.ustc.edu.cn springms
```

The `--engine-registry-mirror https://docker.mirrors.ustc.edu.cn` will add a docker registry mirror settings in docker-machine config. For Chinese users, it will speed up the Docker images downloading.

Then switch to the new created machine **springms**.

```
eval "$(docker-machine env springms)"
```

Forward the virtualbox ports to local system, thus you can access the servers via `localhost` instead of the machine ip addresss.

```
 VBoxManage modifyvm "springms" --natpf1 "tcp-port3306,tcp,,3306,,3306"
 VBoxManage modifyvm "springms" --natpf1 "tcp-port3307,tcp,,3307,,3307"
 VBoxManage modifyvm "springms" --natpf1 "tcp-port5672,tcp,,5672,,5672"
 VBoxManage modifyvm "springms" --natpf1 "tcp-port15672,tcp,,15672,,15672"
 VBoxManage modifyvm "springms" --natpf1 "tcp-port6379,tcp,,6379,,6379"
 VBoxManage modifyvm "springms" --natpf1 "tcp-port27017,tcp,,27017,,27017"
```

Then run the dependent servers via `docker-compose` command line.

For development stage, you can run the services one by one.

```
mvn spring-boot:run // run in user-service, auth-service, post-service
```

The following services will be provided.

|Service|Url|Description|
|---|---|---|
|auth-service|http://localhost:8000/user,http://localhost:8000/auth|Authentication APIs(signin, signup, signout), user info|
|user-service|http://localhost:8001/users|User management APIs|
|post-service|http://localhost:8002/posts|Post and comment APIs|


The authentication flow is:

1. Get authentication from **auth-service**, and get `X-Auth-Token` from response headers.
2. Add `X-Auth-Token` to http request header to access the protected resources.

When all service are running successfully, try to get authentication.

```
curl -v  http://localhost:8000/user -u user:test123
* timeout on name lookup is not supported
*   Trying ::1...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to localhost (::1) port 8000 (#0)
* Server auth using Basic with user 'user'
> GET /user HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:8000
> Authorization: Basic dXNlcjp0ZXN0MTIz
> User-Agent: curl/7.54.0
> Accept: */*
>
< HTTP/1.1 200
< X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff

< Transfer-Encoding: chunked
< Date: Mon, 15 May 2017 09:29:14 GMT
<
{"name":"user","roles":["USER"]}* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact
```

You will see a `X-Auth-Token` header in the response.

Put this header into request header when you access the protected resources in another resource server.

```
curl -v  http://localhost:8001/user -H "x-auth-token: 49090ba7-e641-45e3-935b-894a43b85f62"
``` 

Try to add some posts data:

```
>curl -v  http://localhost:8002/posts 
-H "x-auth-token:  49090ba7-e641-45e3-935b-894a43b85f62" 
-H "Accept: application/json" 
-H "Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8" 
-X POST 
-d "{\"title\": \"test post\", \"content\":\"test content of post\"}"
```

You will see the result. It returns 201 status, and set `Location` header to the new created `Post`.

```
Note: Unnecessary use of -X or --request, POST is already inferred.

{"id":4,"title":"test post","content":"test content of post","status":"DRAFT","author":null,"createdDate":null}*
```

## Run all services via Docker Compose

Run all services in your local system or a staging server.

Build the project via `mvn` command.

```
mvn clean package -DskipTests
```

Then run the following command to run all services.

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.local.yml up
```

Due we have run a Nginx a reverse proxy, all APIs can be accessed through a single entry. 

The following services will be provided.

|Service|Url|Description|
|---|---|---|
|auth-service|http://localhost/user,http://localhost/auth|Authentication APIs(signin, signup, signout), user info|
|user-service|http://localhost/users|User management APIs|
|post-service|http://localhost/posts|Post and comment APIs|

Get authentication.

```
curl -v  http://localhost/user -u user:test123

## Docker Swarm

Use Docker Machine to create multi nodes. In order to demonstrate running this project in Swarm mode, we created two managers and three workers.

```
$ docker-machine create -d virtualbox --engine-registry-mirror https://docker.mirrors.ustc.edu.cn manager1
$ docker-machine create -d virtualbox --engine-registry-mirror https://docker.mirrors.ustc.edu.cn manager2
$ docker-machine create -d virtualbox --engine-registry-mirror https://docker.mirrors.ustc.edu.cn worker1
$ docker-machine create -d virtualbox --engine-registry-mirror https://docker.mirrors.ustc.edu.cn worker2
$ docker-machine create -d virtualbox --engine-registry-mirror https://docker.mirrors.ustc.edu.cn worker3
```

Show the created machines.

```
$ docker-machine ls

```

Switch to `manager1`.

```
eval "$(docker-manager env manager1)"
```

Initializes Docker Swarm.

```
$ docker swarm init --listen-addr 192.168.99.101 --advertise-addr 192.168.99.101
Swarm initialized: current node (t36lxk020fasw5tdes4gm9ucf) is now a manager.

To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:

    docker swarm join \
    --token SWMTKN-1-10bwwj2u6erepp9oc0qlkwao4o79vogifon51qkhdqfsl7zkkd-810eddvkzt2g8vvxb4gul4pnb \
    192.168.99.101:2377

To add a manager to this swarm, run 'docker swarm join-token manager' and follow the instructions.
```

We want to add *manager2* as manager in this swarm. Follow the above info. Execute `docker swarm join-token manager`, it will show the guide to add more managers.

```
$ docker swarm join-token manager
To add a manager to this swarm, run the following command:

    docker swarm join \
    --token SWMTKN-1-10bwwj2u6erepp9oc0qlkwao4o79vogifon51qkhdqfsl7zkkd-4xus5y6wa7a4ass0f5bt20pym \
    192.168.99.101:2377
```
	
Let us switch to *manager2*.

```
eval "$(docker-machine env manager2)"
```

Copy and paste the `docker swarm join` command lines and execute it.

```
$ docker swarm join \
     --token SWMTKN-1-10bwwj2u6erepp9oc0qlkwao4o79vogifon51qkhdqfsl7zkkd-4xus5y6wa7a4ass0f5bt20pym \
     192.168.99.101:2377
This node joined a swarm as a manager.
```

Switch to worker1, worker2, and worker3, join this swarm as a worker.

```
    docker swarm join \
    --token SWMTKN-1-10bwwj2u6erepp9oc0qlkwao4o79vogifon51qkhdqfsl7zkkd-810eddvkzt2g8vvxb4gul4pnb \
    192.168.99.101:2377
```

Switch to any **manager** machine, and you can show all running nodes.

```
$ docker node ls
ID                            HOSTNAME            STATUS              AVAILABILITY        MANAGER STATUS

ovqfs7ymrgbeyfqu8db8n6apc     worker3             Ready               Active
```

Switch to any **manager** machine, deploy all service via `docker stack` command.

```
docker stack deploy -c docker-stack.yml blogapp
```

The services will be scheduled to deploy in this swarm.
